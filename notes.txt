Step 1:
- Unshift is roughly a thousand times slower in this example

	Methods			
	Append Push()		                    Insert Unshift()

Tiny	                84.9 μs(MicroSeconds) s*10^-9		38.5 μs

Medium	                141.7 μs		                    184.5 μs	
Large	                528.2 μs		                    9.2114 ms (miliseconds) s*10^-3

Reasoning:
    The reason the unshift method is slower than the push method is because of memory.
The unshift method must "rellocate memory" in order to insert data before the data
stored in the memory. The push method does not rely on rellocating memory majority of the
time because it can simply add data to the end of the data that is listed.
    The hard proof of this discovery comes from the fact that the push method does
not change dramatically from the varibable number of inputs however the unshift
method's time to complete a task does change from number of inputs.
